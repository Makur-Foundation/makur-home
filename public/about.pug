          | Mercode and its subprojects are existing thanks to the donations of our users and team members. So the progression of Mercode is in the hands of the community. If you would like to see this team contributing more to the community, you can donate us on Patreon to help us paying our server bills or to order us a coffee (because we need it after long hours of coding). If Mercode wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep contributing, *they* will win.

          | MerOS is an Arch based, modern, apt and yaourt compatible, multi-platform, libertarian operating system. It&rsquo;s development is started in Turkey by Tan Siret AKINCI in order to replace pro-nationalist operating systems of the government but later it&rsquo;s development is given to Merith. Now it is the main project of the Mercode team as Merith is the current project leader due to his commits. It&rsquo;s gonna finish very soon as new features are coming everyday. Until that, ou can test MerOS at Mercode stands during open source exhibitions.
